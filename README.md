# SimpleCharts
A tool to generate simple charts in svg, out of custom datasets. 

# How it works!

SimpleCharts generates a set of methods for creating pie-, bar-, doughnut- and linecharts in svg with custom data. The data is sent in the form of an array of objects. There is also possible to include a set of options for style. The components of the charts are made up of individual svg elements. This makes it possible to style them separately with css.
